Notes:

The content of this repo reflects my private working with avr devices. As an Slackware user you can download and install compiler and libc from www.slackbuilds.org. I`m the maintainer of those packages. Feel free to ask for questions regarding it.

My actual hw is a atmega168pa which is a quite nice device. For programming i use an old stk500 wich is connted with my pc via serial cable, but it also works fine with an serial<->usb cable. The libs in src reflect something like building blocks where i create some small hw components to be used in future projects. Within the next checkins you can find the schematics in schematics. 

If you need some inspiration why to use bare metal devices instead of arduino, take a look at this really cool book -> http://makezine.com/2014/03/06/new-avr-programming-book-from-make/ ... Of course i have a copy of it on my desk :-)

I also started playing with arm devices and also there's a book the starting point -> ARM Cortex-M3 Mikrocontroller: Einstieg und Praxis (mitp Professional) ... it's in german. So i added a compiler-switch for changing the devices. @HOME i have only one codebase for both and that switch decide what to build.
